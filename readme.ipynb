    "TFix is a state-of-the-art system for automatically fixing coding errors in programs. The key idea behind TFix is to leverage a large text-to-text Transformer pre-trained on natural languages. This design allows TFix to apply a knowledge transfer between natural and programming languages. In addition to that, TFix is fine-tuned jointly on 52 different error types, which allows it to learn typical patterns across various error types together.\n",
